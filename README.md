# Auphan Software Project

This project is created as an application for a Junior Software Developer position at Auphan Software. For any questions or inquiries, please reach out to the developer at [raulcalero7@gmail.com](mailto:raulcalero7@gmail.com).

## 1. Installation

You can clone the repository using the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/TheCaptainKimchi/auphan-software.git
```

## 2. Server

Run the PHP server based on your preference. This PHP server was served using VS Code's PHP Server extension. If you're hosting the PHP server on a different port, make sure to adjust line 26 in the `script.js` file. The current `script.js` file sends the POST request to `http://localhost:3000/server.php`.

## 3. Index

The project is ready to serve the webpage. This project utilizes VS Code's "Live Server" extension to serve the `index.html` page.
